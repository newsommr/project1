1. What did you like about this website?
    A1. The colors on the webpage work well together. I thought the contact page was really well done and was a good way to incorporate the forum requirement. The service request on the home page had a neat animation that flowed well to the contact page.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    A2. How we had handled nav bars is significantly different and in my opinion provides different user experiences.

    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        A1. I feel as if theres similar user experience between the two websites, though I had opted to use the active css attribute to make navigation between pages a little more dynamic. Though, Riley has much better page layout in my opinion along with better font families.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        A2. Riley's most likely would be more maintainable, I reused alot of css and in-turn realized that my main css file was becoming quickly hard to read. Though our more specific formatting from page to page is pretty similar.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and   directories?
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    A3. I thought Riley's code was very well structured and organized along with a nicely done seperation of css attributes to be applied to the html.

4. Did you find any other issues? if so, briefly enumerate them.
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    A1. I didn't find any semantically incorrect elements in his page.
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    A2. I believe so.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    A5. I like the website alot and felt as if it met all of the requirements thourghly for this assignment. However, the pages sometimes feels a little bit too two-dimensional in some elements of the html and depth could be added by using some css elements/attributes that visually inlay or push out images - just to add another layer of depth to the page.
